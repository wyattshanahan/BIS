# Homework 5 - JavaScript Temperature Converter

Overview: Write a program to do a temperature conversion, based on a radio button input

- Link a javascript function to read in the input textbox and radio button, and output the results into the appropriate area. 
- The program should use 'alert' to print out a message if temperature is not numeric, or if a radio button is not selected
- 
#### Calculations
```

Fahrenheit to Celcius is: (temp_in - 32) * 5 / 9

Celcius to Fahrenheit is: temp_in * 9 / 5 + 32
```

- Note: The isNaN function returns true if a value isn't a number.  An empty value can be tested with the ! operator
