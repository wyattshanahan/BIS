# Homework 1

Write a program to display the contents of 2 files.  The file data is a list of book titles, and links to their cover images (hosted on Wikipedia). 

Your program should read in both files, and create a table displaying the required information

Each row should include the title of the book on the left, and an embedded image tag.

CSS:

  -  Style the borders of the table so they display similarly to the borders shown
   - The font in the headers is taller than the font in the body of the table.
   - The images are constrained to 100px high to shrink them down.
