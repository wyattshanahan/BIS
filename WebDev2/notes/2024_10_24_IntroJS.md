# An Introduction to JavaScript
### The Basics
- To use JS with PHP/HTML, we need to link with ``<script src="name.js" defer></script>``
- ``defer`` is considered more moderate - basically means wait until PHP has *fully* loaded before executing any JS
- ``alert("text")`` can be used to output text with a dialogue box
- JavaScript does not explicitly display error messages on the display screen, these are displayed in the JavaScript console
- For an error message, the file and line number will be shown to the right of the error
### JS Permissions
- JS can check real-time for input, change content on the page, and give user feedback (such as highlighting buttons)
- JS CAN'T access files on the server directly or interact with any other page
- JS and Java are NOT related

### Document-Object Model
- JS uses DOM meaning order of interaction with parts of webpage - such as TAG, ID, or CLASS
- Similar to CSS in some manner
- DOM has some actions for ``getElementById("id")`` such as .onclick or .onmouseover

### Variables
- We must declare variables prior to use with ``var MyVar = "var";
- Types include String, Numbers, Boolean, Objects, and Functions
- Assignment is `=` and string literals are double quotes
- Variables are ***NOT*** strongly typed
- Generally, a variable needs to be global if we want to remember it between clicks

### If Statements
- Same as PHP
