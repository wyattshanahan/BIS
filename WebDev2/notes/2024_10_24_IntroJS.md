# An Introduction to JavaScript
### The Basics
- To use JS with PHP/HTML, we need to link with ``<script src="name.js" defer></script>``
- ``defer`` is considered more moderate - basically means wait until PHP has *fully* loaded before executing any JS
- ``alert("text")`` can be used to output text with a dialogue box
### JS Permissions
- JS can check real-time for input, change content on the page, and give user feedback (such as highlighting buttons)
- JS CAN'T access files on the server directly or interact with any other page
- JS and Java are NOT related

### Document-Object Model
- JS uses DOM meaning order of interaction with parts of webpage - such as TAG, ID, or CLASS
- Similar to CSS in some manner
