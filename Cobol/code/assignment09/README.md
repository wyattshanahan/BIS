# Assignment 9 - Fruit Web Form

Write a web page (Fruit-02.html) that a web-based user can use to get inventory information. You will create a web page that displays a list of fruits that you have in inventory. Display only the fruit name (get the names from the file FixedFruits.txt, the same data file from assignment #8). These records contain fixed-length fields:

- fruit name

- quantity on hand

- price per item

 

Also, available in /home/bis4523/resources/images/fruits, you will find an image file for each of the fruits.

When the user selects a fruit from your initial web page, submit a request for your Fruit-02 COBOL program, which will read the records in FixedFruits.txt, find the corresponding item, and display the following on a well-formatted web page:

-    fruit name
 -   quantity on hand
  -  price per item
   - the image of the fruit (you should still have these in your public_html directory)

You will find it helpful to copy the cobol functions from the repo to your public_html directory
