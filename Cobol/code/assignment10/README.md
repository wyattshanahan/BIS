# Assignment 10 - Freestyle!

- This assignment requires you to follow your own path.  You will write a COBOL program (and other ancillary files) that will meet the following:

1). Generate .CGI output including images

2).  Allow the user to interact with the program and produce desired results on the .CGI webpage

3). Read from an external file

- Take a look at the [class webpage](https://mislab.business.msstate.edu/~kmarett/) for examples to inspire you.  Higher grades on this assignment will require some creativity, so push the envelope!
