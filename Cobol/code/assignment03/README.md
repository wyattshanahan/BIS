# Assignment 3

- Write a COBOL program which will read the data from the input file States.txt.
- Display output to the screen and generate a report into an output file named States-01-output.txt.

Generally, the procedure should:

- Initialization: Perform any one-time activities that are necessary prior to your data processing.
-    Processing: Perform your processing paragraph until an end-of-file flag data item is Y (be sure to initialize that data item to N, either with the value clause or in your initialization paragraph). This will require a repetition statement (a Perform/Until statement).
 -   Termination: Perform any one-time activities that are necessary after your last inventory item.
  -  Stop the execution of your program.
