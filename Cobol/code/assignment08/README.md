# Assignment 8 - Fruit Webpage

*Some dependencies are not listed and can be found in the public_html directory*

Write a web page (Fruit-01.cgi) that a web-based user can use to get inventory information. You will create a web page that displays a list of fruits that you have in an inventory table. Get the names from the file FixedFruits.txt, which is available in /home/bis4523/resources/data. These records contain three fixed-length fields:

- fruit name

- quantity on hand

- price per item

 

Also, available in /home/bis4523/resources/images/fruits, you will find an image file for each of the fruits.  You will also want to upload the .css stylesheet cobol.css to your public_html directory... this file can be found in /home/bis4523/resources/code.

Display the following on a well-formatted web page:

  -  fruit name
   - quantity on hand
 -   price per item
  -  the image of the fruit
