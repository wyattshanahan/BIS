## Intro to Web Programming with COBOL

- We need ``77 xNewLine pic x value x"0a".`` for HTTP purposes
- What our COBOL program is actually producing is an HTTP response
- Entering a URL is sending an HTTP request
### HTTP Response has 3 Components:
1) Response Header
2) Blank Line
3) Response Body

- Due to the HTTP requirement for a blank like, we must have the xNewLine (defined above)
- We also use Hexidecimal (16 digits) in the response with xNewLine
- "0a" is a blank line via a Carriage return line feed
- ``"Content-type: text/html", xNewLine`` is the Response Header and Blnk Line
- The response body is everything from ``<!doctype html>`` to ``</html>``

### CGI document Requires:
1) ``"<!doctype html>"``
2) ``<html></html>``
3) ``<head></head>``
4) ``<body></body>``
