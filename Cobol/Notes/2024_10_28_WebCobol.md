## Intro to Web Programming with COBOL

- We need ``77 xNewLine pic x value x"0a".`` for HTTP purposes
- What our COBOL program is actually producing is an HTTP response
- Entering a URL is sending an HTTP request
- Make sure all files are in the public_html directory
- ``cd public_html`` to change directory 
- ``ls -l`` to do a file listing
- change file extemtion via ``mv file file.cgi``
- For the .cgi file to be useful, we need to adjust file permissions
- We can adjust with ``chmod 700 file.cgi``

### HTTP Response has 3 Components:
1) Response Header
2) Blank Line
3) Response Body

- Due to the HTTP requirement for a blank like, we must have the xNewLine (defined above)
- We also use Hexidecimal (16 digits) in the response with xNewLine
- "0a" is a blank line via a Carriage return line feed
- ``"Content-type: text/html", xNewLine`` is the Response Header and Blnk Line
- The response body is everything from ``<!doctype html>`` to ``</html>``

### CGI document Requires:
1) ``"<!doctype html>"``
2) ``<html></html>``
3) ``<head></head>``
4) ``<body></body>``

### File Permissions:
1) Read - 4 pts
2) Write - 2 pts
3) xecute - 1 pt

- File Permissions are in sets of three:
1) File Owner Perms
2) Group Perms
3) Global Perms

- File perms have a points system, we want to disable write perms for out .cgi file
- We can adjust with ``chmod 700 file.cgi``
