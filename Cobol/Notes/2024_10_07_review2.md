## Exam 2 Review - Exam window opens 12:01 AM on Tuesday

Entering information into a PIC clause which is too small causes truncation
example: PIC n(5) would receive 12345 from 123456
- for the last data item of input, can sometimes benefit from making PIC clause a bit larger than needed
- Exam sounds similar to capital table assignment - will NOT use states as the data item stored in the table
