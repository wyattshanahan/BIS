- Control breaks used for sorting
- Sort table by e/w, dept number, etc.
- Given we are using a free compiler, it's easier to sort alphanumeric data items compared to numeric data items
- If data does not show up, change ascending to descending for sorted data (or just don't allocate an extra space in memory?)
