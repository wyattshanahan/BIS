## COBOL HTML Review

- COBOL generates an HTTP response
- We use .cgi files (Common Gateway Interface)
- Stylesheets dictate where and how elements display across the page
- Course-standard CSS is in ``/home/bis4523/resources/code/cobol.css``

### HTTP RESPONSE REQUIRES
- HTTP Header
- Blank Line
- HTTP Body

### HTML Table 
- ``<table></table>`` surrounding
- A row is denoted by ``<tr></tr>``
- A data is denoted by ``<td></td>``
