## Declaring Data Items

-  They're not variables, they're "data items"
-  Variables must be declared in the ``DATA DIVISION`` prior to usage
-  Place independent variables in the ``WORKING-STORAGE SECTION`` - don't interact with a heirarchy of data items
-  Must obey the restrictions on user-defined names

## Class Naming Conventions
- Name each variable logically
- Use data-type prefix (n, ne, x, g, etc.)
