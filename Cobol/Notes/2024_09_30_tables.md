- COBOL calls arrays 'tables'

- Elements are objects inside of array, and tables are stored in RAM
- COBOL arrays are 1-based meaning they start with index 1
- Runtime error if try to use table that's too small

TABLE NAMING
- 01 to name table
- 05 names an element - makes it a able because of ``occurs`` clause
- 10 names elements of elements
- 15 names elements of 10 (such as YYYY, MM, DD of a date)

- nLoadSubscript used for loading values into array, start it at 0 and increment prior to use (since tables are 1-based)

- initial value (first num in the varying)
- incremental value (what do we increment by)?

ex `` PERFORM ROUTINE varying SUBSCRIPT from initial by incremental until condition``
