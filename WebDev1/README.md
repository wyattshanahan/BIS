# Assignments

## Homework 2

Overview:  This week’s homework uses 2 web pages.  One HTML page for input, and one PHP page for output.  Your input page should include an option list, a text input, 3 radio buttons, and a text area.  You may duplicate the exact example below, or make up your own example. 

Your output form should include print out all of the inputs that the user selected in some form.  It should include a multiple column section, and an image.  You may duplicate the exact output example shown below, or make up your own.  The input screen should match the example below. 

## Homework 3

Overview:  Write a program to calculate a weighted average for a course.  Your input form should allow the user to enter their name, and the appropriate grades as shown below.  Style your input form into three columns.  Please note, even though you have 3 columns in your input screen, there should be only one <form> element, and all your inputs must be inside it.  Your sections for columns should all be inside the <form> group.  

Calculations: Exams are worth 85%,  and homeworks are worth 15%.  Results should be formatted to 2 decimal places.

## Homework 4

Input: The user should be allowed to enter in a height and radius, and select one from a list of shapes using radio buttons.  It should then calculate and print out the surface area of the object.  Surface area for the various objects can be calculated by using the formulas found online.

 
The function pi() can be used to get the value of pi, and sqrt() finds the square root.  For example, the volume of a cone could be calculated in PHP like this:

   $result = pi()*$radius*$radius + pi()*$radius*sqrt($height*$height+$radius*$radius);

 

Your program should ensure that both text inputs are numeric, and that a radio button was selected, printing out error messages if data was incorrectly entered. 

## Homework 5

Overview:  Write a program to project several years of population growth.  The user should be able to enter in the number of years, the current population, and the growth rate.  Your output screen should print out the numbers the user entered, as well as the results in a table. Style the table as shown below (though exact colors don’t have to match).   Include a link back to the input form. Format the numbers in your output. 

## Homework 6

Overview: Write a PHP function to find the Max of three numbers.   Your program should allow the user to input 3 numbers, and then 'call' your function to print out which is the largest.   Your main program should handle reading in the 3 numbers, and then calling the function with a print command.  The program should pass the 3 values to the function, and the function use the 'return' command to send back out the value.

Your function will need to use a series of "if" statements to find the maximum value.   Note: There is a built in max() function in PHP, don't use it for this assignment. 

## Homework 7

Overview:  This program uses the files students.names.txt and students.grades.txt. The files contain a list of students names, along with their corresponding grades.

Your program should consist of a single PHP file, that will allow the user to search for a particular letter grade in the file, and print out every student who has a grade that meets that criteria.

## Homework 8

Overview:  This program uses one PHP file.  The initial screen presents the user with a list of radio buttons to choose dive sites.  Once one is chosen and the submit button is clicked, the program searches through the file dives.txt, and prints out a summary of information on that site.

Each line of the file contains 4 fields, the name of the site, the type of dive, the depth of the dive, and the duration of the dive.  The fields are separated by commas. 

Total number of dives, and total time underwater should also be printed out.
